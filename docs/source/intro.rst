Brief Overview
--------------

Bismillaah,

We introduce a brief description of the argoPlot-script userguide document. 

This document has been prepared as a guide for downloading and visualize the argoFloat data using python script-based.

- the script are command-line-based applications that can be useful to display argoFloat data processing results in NetCDF format.
- the argoFloat are widely used by scientists and researchers in several earth science fields, such as climate science, oceanography and the atmosphere.
- in addition to visualizing scientific data, the script can track the argopath, including the parameters variability analysis.
- on the other hand, the argoPlot-script focuses on data visualization, allowing users to create maps easily, and plots from the float data. 

The script is used on operating systems such as Windows, macOS, and Linux.
However, this document only describes the guide for the linux operating system. This document explains the prerequrement import packages on the jupyter notebook of python.

The stages in of the userguide are as follows:

1. Download the argoFloat data,
2. Visualize the downloaded data.

The stages are challenging since the jupyter notebook is installed on the conda environments of python, which runs on the Linux operating system.
In brief, the steps are as follows:

1. install the prerequirements library packages,
2. import the libraries,
3. download and visualize the argoFloat data.
